# Data types:
    
#     Data ---> 
    
# 1) Integer
#     123, 34, -324, 123


# 2) Float
#     10.6, 23.5
    
# 3) String
#     'this is a string'
#     "this is also a string"
#     """this is also a string"""
#     "10"

# 4) Boolean
#         True, False

# 5) Complex
#         a + bj --> 10 + 20j



# # Array, -------------

# 6) List
#     [12, 34, 45, "hello", "no", 10.5]

# 7) tuple (12, 34, 45, 56, 67,78)
# 8) set  {12, 34, 5, 67, 78, 90}
# 9) dictionry {key : value}
    
    
# Indentifires:
    
#     Name --> Veriable, function name, class name, 
    
# Rules:
    
#     1) always start from charcter or underscore (_).
#     2) never statrt from any integer.
#     3) never hold spaces
#     4) never hold any spacial symbols @#@$#%^&*()^)(*^&%)
#     5) never be a keyword.
    

# keyword :::: are the spacial words. that are reserved by a language for there spacial use.

# int, float, def, class, str, try, ,,........
    

# Veriable : 
#         ---> are the containers use to hold data for fututre use.

# abc = 20

# x = 200

# _x = 20

# a1 = 100

# full name = "hellooo"

# full_name = "helloooo"

# xy!~@@# = 92834



# int = 10

# def = 20


# Functions:
#     1) Built in functions:
#         --> pre define
    
#     2) user define function
            


# 1) print()
# 2) input()
# 3) type()
# 4) len()
# 5) count()


# x()


# 1) print() :::
#     --> help to show anything on console. 

# print("helow world")

# x = 1000

# print(x)

# print("hello", x, "no", x, x)


# zx = 2

# pq = 3

# x = zx + pq

# print(zx, pq, x, sep = "-")

# phone_number = 9823482364


# print("User name is ", name, "the age is ", age, "and number is ", phone_number)

# f-string ---> 

# print(f"user name is {name} and user age is {age} and user phone number is {phone_number}")


# type()
# -----> use to know what type of data a veriable hold..
